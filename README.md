# Chess AI

This is a chess game where players can play against each other or better, they can play against the AI. The AI will have different levels: Adpative, Beginner, Intermediate, Advanced and Impossible, where a player can test his chess skills against this adaptive opponent. Be careful though, the opponent can trash talk you real bad when you are losing!
